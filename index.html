        Don Drumphet lives in a nice neighborhood, but one of his neighbors has started to let his house go. <br>
        Don Drumphet wants to build a wall between his house and his neighbor’s, and is trying to get the neighborhood <br>
        association to pay for it. He begins to solicit his neighbors to petition to get the association to build the <br>
        wall. Unfortunately for Don Drumphet, he cannot read very well, has a very limited attention span, and can only <br>
        remember two letters from each of his neighbors’ names. As he collects signatures, he insists that his neighbors <br>
        keep truncating their names until two letters remain, and he can finally read them.<br>
<br>
        Your code will show Full name of the neighbor and the truncated version of the name as an array. If the number of the <br>
        characters in name is less than or equal to two, it will return an array containing only the name as is"<br>
